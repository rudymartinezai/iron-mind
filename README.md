# üõ°Ô∏è Iron Mind

**Forged in Rust. Secured by code. Verified by the chain.**

---

## Overview

**Iron Mind** is an open-source Rust-based firewall framework leveraging blockchain-backed verification.  
It focuses on decentralized trust, auditable policy control, and next-generation network defense.  
Designed for builders, researchers, and security engineers who believe perimeter security should evolve into trustless, verifiable intelligence.

---

## Core Principles

- **Decentralized Trust** ‚Äì Firewall configurations and events can be verified via blockchain consensus, ensuring no tampering or silent modifications.
- **Immutable Audit Logs** ‚Äì Security events and rule changes are hashed and stored immutably for forensic traceability.
- **Performance First** ‚Äì Built in Rust for safe concurrency, minimal overhead, and uncompromising reliability.
- **Extensible Architecture** ‚Äì Modular components for packet inspection, signature verification, and smart-contract based rule validation.

## Vision

Traditional firewalls defend networks by standing guard at the perimeter.  
**Iron Mind** redefines that model by treating every node as an intelligent, verifiable security participant.  
The future of defense isn‚Äôt just secure‚Äîit‚Äôs **provable**.
